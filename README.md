### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jacob Torres. I'm a software engineer with an emphasis on data and machine learning. I'm nearing the end of my education in data science and computer science, and am excited to apply my skills to real-world projects. My favorite passtime is learning new things; there's no technology or problem I'm unwilling to tackle.

Some of my passions include:

- Software and game accessibility
- Optimization with data and machine learning
- Language learning (both human and computer languages)
- World travel
- Historical analysis

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

- Data engineer for [Scribble Stadium Arcade](https://github.com/BloomTech-Labs/scribble-stadium-ds): cleaning, transferring, and building a data pipeline in the cloud using AWS.
- Developing a Flask application to host a custom Nearest Neighbors model for [Spotify song suggestion](https://github.com/jacob-torres/Spotify-Song-Suggester).
