### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jacob Torres. I'm a writer, web developer, and accessibility consultant, and I'm absolutely obsessed with  learning and creating.

My favorite passtime is researching new things; there's no technology or problem I'm unwilling to tackle. I strive for excellence and mastery in everythingI do.

I have 4+ years of experience  with Python, SQL, Java, and JavaScript. I'm actively learning TypeScript and Scala, and I plan on delving into C++ and Julia in the future, among others.

Some of my passions include:

- Automation and scripting
- Software and game accessibility
- Music
- Language learning (both human and computer)
- History
- Political science
- World travel

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

- [Story Builder](https://github.com/jacob-torres/story-builder): A Django web app for writers to organize their ideas into solid story structures.
- [Travel Planner](https://github.com/jacob-torres/travel-planner/): A full Stack Web Application for making integrated travel plans all on one platform. I'm building it in Angular and Spring Boot, with plans on implementing several third-party API's and Kafka for data streaming.
