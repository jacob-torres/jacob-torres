### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jake Torres. I'm a software developer with an emphasis on data engineering and machine learning. My favorite passtime is learning new things; there's no technology or problem I'm unwilling to tackle. I strive for excellence and mastery in everythingI do.

I have 3+ years of programming experience  with Python, SQL, Java, and JavaScript. I'm actively learning Scala and C, and I plan on picking up Go, Rust, and Perl, among others.

Some of my passions include:

- Automation and scripting
- Building data pipelines and dashboards
- Optimization with data and machine learning
- Software and game accessibility
- Language learning (both human and computer)
- Historical analysis
- Political science
- World travel
